Welcome to our ML project!

In this project, we are using a PDF file called "sample.pdf" as our input/training data. We have two methods to extract text from this PDF file:

1. "tfplib.ipynb": This method uses the PyPDF2 library to directly extract text from the PDF file.

2. "tfpocr.ipynb": This method converts the PDF file into images and then uses an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithm to extract text from those images.
